<h3>Dual keys</h3>

<p>
  Relieve stress from you pinkies by moving hard-to-reach characters to the modifier keys, without
  losing the ability to use them as modifier keys.

<h4>Notes</h4>

  This mod is made for a US Qwerty keyboard with additional thumb keys that can be used as modifier
  keys. If you want to use a different keyboard layout or otherwise remap the keys, please download
  <a href="https://github.com/pqrs-org/KE-complex_modifications">the source code</a> and modify
