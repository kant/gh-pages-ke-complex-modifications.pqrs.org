<h4>Usage Notes</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Space should be your default choice for the trigger key, as it's the easiest to reach and the
    most ergonomic option. However, Tab is also provided as an option, so that if you have a
    keyboards with two spacebars, so you can map one to Space, one to Tab, and use both as the
    trigger key.</li>
  <li>If you want to use a different keyboard layout or another key as the trigger key, please download
    <a href="https://github.com/pqrs-org/KE-complex_modifications">the source code</a> and modify
    <a href="https://github.com/pqrs-org/KE-complex_modifications/tree/master/src/json/ergoemacs_mode.json.rb">this
      file</a>.</li>
  <li><p>In <a href="http://zsh.sourceforge.net">Zsh</a>, the command <code>backward-kill-line</code>
    does not have a keybinding by default and the shortcut for "Delete to beginning of line" will
    delete the whole line instead. To get it to work correctly,  you need to add the following to
    your <code>~/.zshrc</code> file:</p>
    <pre>bindkey "^U" backward-kill-line</pre>
    <p>If you are using
    <a href="https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto/tree/master/modules/editor">Prezto's
    editor module</a>, then this is included automatically.</p></li>
</ul>
